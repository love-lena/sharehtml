# sharehtml

I've been using coding agents to write in markdown, make slides, and build interactive data analysis as static HTML files. Sending those files around still gets messy fast: you can't update them after sharing, and there's no way to get feedback inline. This is the reason I built sharehtml.

## What is sharehtml?

Deploy a local document, get a link where others can view it and collaborate with comments, reactions, and live presence. Re-deploy to update the content at the same URL. Markdown and common code files are converted to styled HTML automatically.

- **CLI deploys** — `sharehtml deploy report.html` → `https://artifacts.example.com/d/9brkzbe67ntm`
- **Collaborative** — comments, threaded replies, emoji reactions, text anchoring
- **Live presence** — see who's viewing and their selections
- **Home page** — your documents and recently viewed docs shared with you
- **Self-hosted** — runs on your own Cloudflare account

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (for the CLI and setup script)
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) with [R2 enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/#free-tier) (free tier available)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/love-lena/sharehtml.git
cd sharehtml
pnpm install
npx wrangler login
pnpm run setup
```

The interactive setup script walks you through the Custom Domain or `workers.dev` choice, R2 bucket creation, deployment, CLI installation, and authentication. Cloudflare Access is optional — without it, anyone with a link can view and comment. For a concrete personal-domain walkthrough, see [Personal Cloudflare deployment](docs/personal-cloudflare.md).
If you enable Cloudflare Access, setup also provisions the production `VIEWER_CAPABILITY_SECRET` used to sign browser capability tokens for the trusted viewer shell.

To install the CLI directly:

```bash
# with Bun
bun install -g sharehtml

# or with npm (Bun still needs to be installed for the CLI runtime)
npm install -g sharehtml
```

If your team already has a sharehtml worker deployed, this is probably all you need — install the CLI, run `sharehtml config set-url <your-team-url>`, then `sharehtml login`.

If you enable Cloudflare Access, you'll need a [Cloudflare API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) with these permissions:
- **Account > Access: Apps and Policies > Edit**
- **Account > Access: Organization, Identity Providers, and Groups > Read**
- **Account > Workers Scripts > Read** (only when resolving a `workers.dev` subdomain)

When it's done, try deploying one of the included examples:

```bash
sharehtml deploy example/coffee-report.html
# or try the markdown example:
sharehtml deploy example/sample.md
# or the interactive slideshow example:
sharehtml deploy example/nba-slideshow.html
# or deploy a code file:
sharehtml deploy apps/cli/src/index.ts
```

If a document with the same filename exists, the CLI will prompt to update it. Use `-u` to skip the prompt.

### Manual deploy

If you've already run setup and just need to redeploy:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

If `AUTH_MODE=access`, make sure the production worker already has `VIEWER_CAPABILITY_SECRET` configured. `pnpm run setup` handles that automatically.

To create it manually:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
npx wrangler secret put VIEWER_CAPABILITY_SECRET --env production
```

### Local development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Starts the Vite dev server with Wrangler at http://localhost:5173. Local dev uses the default environment — `AUTH_MODE` is `"none"`, no login required.
Local development does not require `VIEWER_CAPABILITY_SECRET`.

To use the CLI locally:

```bash
sharehtml config set-url http://localhost:5173
sharehtml deploy my-report.html
```

## Architecture

```
CLI ──► Worker ──► R2 (HTML storage)
         │
Browser ◄┘──► Durable Objects
               ├── RegistryDO (users, documents, views)
               └── DocumentDO (per-doc comments, reactions, presence via WebSocket)
```

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **[Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)** | HTTP routing, auth, serves viewer shell and home page |
| **RegistryDO** | Global [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) — users, document metadata, view history (SQLite) |
| **DocumentDO** | Per-document Durable Object — comments, reactions, real-time presence over WebSocket |
| **[R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)** | Stores the actual HTML files |
| **CLI** | Bun-based command-line tool for deploying and managing documents |

### Uploaded document security

Uploaded documents run in a sandboxed iframe and receive a restrictive Content Security Policy. Inline scripts and styles are supported for self-contained artifacts; network connections, external subresources, forms, objects, and nested frames are blocked. Images, fonts, and media must be embedded as `data:` or `blob:` URLs. Opening an external link through the trusted viewer shell requires a browser confirmation.

When Markdown images are converted to data URLs, the CLI only reads supported image files inside the Markdown file's own directory. Parent-directory paths and symlinks that escape that directory are left untouched.

### Custom domains

Choose **Publish on a custom domain** during `pnpm run setup` and enter a hostname such as `artifacts.example.com`. The hostname must be in an active Cloudflare zone with no conflicting DNS record. Setup writes a Workers Custom Domain route and disables the public `workers.dev` endpoint; Cloudflare then manages DNS and TLS automatically.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sharehtml deploy <file>` | Deploy an HTML, Markdown, or code file (creates or updates) |
| `sharehtml list` | List your documents |
| `sharehtml open <id>` | Open a document in the browser |
| `sharehtml pull <id>` | Download a document locally |
| `sharehtml diff <file>` | Compare local file against the deployed version |
| `sharehtml comments <id>` | Show unresolved comments for a document |
| `sharehtml delete <id>` | Delete a document |
| `sharehtml share <document>` | Share by link, or `--add`/`--remove` emails |
| `sharehtml unshare <document>` | Make a document private |
| `sharehtml skill install` | Install the agent skill for Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode |
| `sharehtml login` | Log in through Cloudflare Access |
| `sharehtml config set-url <url>` | Set the sharehtml URL |
| `sharehtml config show` | Show current configuration |

## Agent Skill

Install the sharehtml skill to let coding agents deploy documents, compare changes, and review comments on your behalf. The skill teaches agents to diff before overwriting and keep documents private by default. Run `sharehtml skill install` to set it up for Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode.

## Configuration

Production auth vars live in `wrangler.jsonc` under `env.production.vars`, set by `pnpm run setup`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AUTH_MODE` | Yes | `"none"` disables auth, `"access"` enables Cloudflare Access JWT verification |
| `ACCESS_AUD` | When `AUTH_MODE=access` | Cloudflare Access Application Audience tag |
| `ACCESS_TEAM` | When `AUTH_MODE=access` | Cloudflare Access team name |

Production secrets:

| Secret | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `VIEWER_CAPABILITY_SECRET` | When `AUTH_MODE=access` | Wrangler secret used to sign short-lived browser capability tokens. These tokens let the trusted parent viewer shell call privileged browser endpoints without giving the same authority to untrusted uploaded JS running inside the sandboxed iframe. |
